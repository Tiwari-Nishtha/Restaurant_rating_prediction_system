* Dataset

THE DATASET USED IN THIS PROJECT CONTAINS INFORMATION ABOUT RESTAURANTS, INCLUDING

* Country Code
* City
* Cuisines
* Currency
* Has Table booking
* Has Online delivery
* Is delivering now
* Switch to order menu
* Rating color

* Aggregate rating (target variable)

  
PREPROCESSING

1. Handling Missing Values:
* Numerical missing values are filled with the mean.
* Categorical missing values are filled with the mode.

2. Encoding Categorical Variables:
* Categorical variables are converted into dummy/indicator variables.

3. Splitting the Data:
* The dataset is split into training and testing sets with an 80-20 ratio.
Models

TWO REGRESSION ALGORITHMS ARE USED IN THIS PROJECT
* Linear Regression
* Decision Tree Regression
  
EVALUATION

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* R-squared (RÂ²)

FEATURE IMPORTANCE

* The feature importance is calculated for the Decision Tree model and visualized using a bar plot.
